At the end of the hallway is Krampus elf.  He goes into a room.  The room has a closet with a lock.

There is a key machine outside.

</figure>

The machine creates a key (image) that is based on the numbers provided

The name of the file corresponds to the numbers to the machine.  So, maybe we just need to create the right filename?

Exif does not show any metadata.  So likely, the file name and maybe the image size are important.  Therefore, the same image could be submitted in a brute force.

However, this game doesn't really work with brute force.  and since there are 999999 potential answers, we likely need to get a smaller number

The DevantOllam talk is about creating a key from a photograph of a key.

The key image was part of the Krampus avatar. The key is isolated here

Going into the closet, the lock is a Schlage, so that is the guide we will use

The values appear to be 122520 (which is the date of christmas next year)

This opened me to a room that says "This is it"

Krampus took the turtle doves, but wants me to get past Frido Sleigh
