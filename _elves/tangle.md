Tangle is asking us to figure out the keypad.

My oldest daughter realized right away that the smudges show which buttons are pressed the most.  My son worked on the combo.  When we wrote the numbers on the board of order of biggest smudge, we realized it was "leet".  We honestly forgot to read the hints from the elf.

Note, the photo makes it even more obvious which numbers are pressed the most.
